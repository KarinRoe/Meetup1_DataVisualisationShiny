# Introduction to Interactive Data Visualisation


In this inaugural workshop, we will discuss the importance of Data Visualisation in Machine Learning projects and demonstrate how to create an Interactive Data Visualisation Dashboard using Shiny (an R package). By the end of this workshop, you will have learned about the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and will have practical experience in building an interactive dashboard.

Shiny is an R library for building interactive webapps. Shiny allows rapid prototyping and quick production of dashboards and interactive data visualizations. This is especially important in situations where putting a real data-driven prototype in the hands of the end user allows for better refining of requirements before passing off to a web development team. In our team we have used this approach in several projects, speeding up the delivery process and reducing the dependencies on other teams. 
 
In this workshop we will cover the basis of reactive programming and shiny app structure and we will have a hands-on section where you will be able to build your own shiny app. As the concepts covered are transversal to the python alternatives to shiny (dash and bokeh) this can be a good opportunity to get started in webapp design in your favourite language!

The only requirement for attending this workshop is that you will need to bring your own laptop. If you have some experience with R, this would be helpful but is not essential.
